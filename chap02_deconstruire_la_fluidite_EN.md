# Introduction: The Illusion of Fluidity in Existence, Between Perception and Mathematics

**Persistence of vision**, the impression that light continues to move in our sight even though it’s still, perfectly illustrates the **illusion of fluidity** in our existence. When we follow a light with our eyes, it is our eye that creates the sense of movement, while in reality, everything is static. There is no actual movement, only a perception we generate by following something immobile. It’s the same with life: what we perceive as a **fluid flow of time** is actually just a **large equation** already laid out.

Existence is not a series of frozen moments, but a **complete mathematical structure**, a code that exists fully in a timeless space. It’s not a sequence of events we connect to create meaning or a fluid narrative, but rather a **static formula** that we interpret as movement. We simply glide through this code, like a point on a path, and our perception of passing time is an **illusion**, a way of making a reality that is, in fact, **cold** and **precise**, governed by determined rules, appear alive.

This illusion of **continuity** and **fluidity** gives the impression that time flows, that we evolve, but in truth, everything is already written. Everything is there, laid out flat. We create **movement**, we create **time**, we create **meaning**, but these are just interpretations of our **"mind"**. This connection between the coldness of **mathematics** and the apparent warmth of life is at the core of how we understand existence: **we exist** not because we live events in succession, but because we interpret a **vast mathematical whole** as a fluid, linear experience.

# The God-Self Hypothesis

What if I existed alone, as a god? If everything around me were just a creation of my divine mind, a world shaped to entertain me? This hypothesis always leaves me a bit perplexed, because it seems too focused on singularity, on the idea that I would be the center of everything. I tend to drown the fish rather than bring it out of the water. I struggle with this exaltation of divine individuality, as I prefer the idea of balance, neutrality, something much larger where I am not the center. I am not "special."

I’ve always been more comfortable with concepts where the self is neutral, where it blends into a multitude rather than standing out. The idea of being ordinary, part of a whole, without any claim to uniqueness, seems far more elegant than a powerful god reigning over a universe created solely for them. Imagining that everything revolves around me, that this world exists only for my pleasure, feels unpleasant—it’s a vision that, to me, lacks subtlety.

However, imagining a scenario where each person is a god in their own universe, where every being lives in a reality where they are at the center, that could work. In my universe, I would be god, but in your universe, you would be god too. This plurality of perspectives, this infinity of individual realities where each is the center of their own world, ultimately connects back to the idea of individual universes (cf. [chap01](chap01_univers_individuels_EN.md)). If everyone is a god in their universe, then no one really is, and everyone is at the same time. It almost neutralizes the notion of divinity, making it mundane. A god in an infinity of gods—ultimately, nothing special.

There may be a nuance to explore, between a god-self universe and multiverses where we are all gods. Perhaps one day, I’ll take the time to reflect on it.
