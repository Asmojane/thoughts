# Relativity and Interdependence: The Meeting of Individual Multiverses

The idea that each individual perceives reality differently is not just an intuition or a metaphor. It’s a reality: **there are as many universes as there are spectators**. At every moment, **my reality is only the result of my interpretation**, shaped by my experiences, my thoughts, and my beliefs. And when our universes meet, neutral reality doesn’t exist; it is never fixed or objective.

It’s like when **my yellow vision meets your red**: the **orange** that results exists only because we’ve had to find common ground. This compromise doesn’t just concern our immediate perceptions, but extends to **all our interactions**, whether they are physical, emotional, or spiritual.

## The Compromise: A Physical and Spiritual Reality

This compromise, this blend of perceptions, is both **concrete** and **ephemeral**. It is **physical** because we are constantly interacting with others, confronting our points of view, and adapting our behavior based on how we perceive each other. But it is also **spiritual**: it’s the idea that **my truth**, as absolute as it may seem to me, can never exist in isolation. **It must collide with yours**, and together, we create a **shared reality** that is neither fully yours nor fully mine.

This compromise is a **dynamic process**, a perpetual adjustment between different truths, each shaped by its own context. **The orange** is not a simple static blend; it’s an **exchange ground**, a place where our truths must coexist without ever completely erasing each other.

In other words, **the reality we experience is not neutral**. It is the product of our interactions, our confrontations, and our adjustments. Each moment of our life is an exchange between multiple universes, and the result is a compromise, an **ephemeral “orange”** that couldn’t exist without **my yellow perception** and **your red**.


## Exploring How Each Person Co-Creates a Unique Reality Based on Their Own Inner Universe

Each person lives in their own **inner universe**, and this universe is not just a vague or abstract impression. It’s a tangible reality: **there are as many universes as there are spectators**. My perception of the world is not neutral; it’s shaped by everything I’ve lived, everything I believe, and everything I feel. **I’m constantly creating my reality**, not in isolation, but through this unique lens that belongs to me.

When I look at the world, I don’t just see objective facts or universal truths. **I see a universe that I’ve constructed**, filtered through my experiences, emotions, and beliefs. We all do this; each of us has our own inner universe that coexists with those of others. So, when our universes meet, it’s not a homogeneous blend, but a **collision of perspectives**, a meeting that produces a compromise, something **new and ephemeral**.

### The Inner Universe as a Filter of Perception

Everything I perceive passes through my **inner filter**. What I’ve experienced, what I believe to be true, what I feel at a given moment: all of this influences how I see the world. **My perception is a projection**, a kind of distorting mirror that shows me a version of the world that exists only for me. And it’s the same for you, for everyone. **What you see**, what you feel, is your own version of reality.

Human interactions are, therefore, a meeting of these inner universes. **When I speak with you**, it’s not just a conversation; it’s an **exchange of realities**. Your perception influences mine, and vice-versa, but this doesn’t create a neutral or objective truth. **What we create together** is a compromise, a new temporary reality. It’s like the **orange** that comes from the meeting of **my yellow** and **your red**: this orange exists only because our two universes met at that specific moment.

### The Compromise: A Physical and Spiritual Reality

This compromise, this **“orange”**, is both **physical** and **spiritual**. It’s physical because our interactions concretely modify our behavior, the way we react to each other. It’s spiritual because **our truths collide** and must coexist. **My truth is not more absolute than yours**, but it doesn’t exist alone either. It’s in this compromise that we find common ground, but this ground is neither permanent nor fixed.

**The reality I live is not a universal fact**. It’s the result of my interactions with the world, with you, with others. This compromise is **ephemeral**, and it constantly changes depending on who I meet, what I learn, and how I perceive the world at each moment.

## Connecting to Scientific or Philosophical Concepts

### Relativity in Physics: The Role of the Observer

As in physics, where **the observer modifies what is observed**, my perception influences reality. There is no neutral or absolute reality. It’s like **Einstein’s theory of relativity**, where time and space are not fixed constants but change depending on the observer. It’s the same with my reality: it depends on **my frame of reference**, my inner universe. **My point of view** shapes what I see, just as your point of view shapes what you see.

### Constructivism in Psychology: The Active Construction of Reality

In psychology, **constructivism** posits that I don’t just receive information from the world passively; I **actively construct** it. What I perceive is actually a **creation of my mind**, a filter that interprets sensory data based on my mental schemas. **Each person actively creates their own version of the world**, based on their experiences and beliefs. It’s not just a reaction, it’s a continuous and personal creation of reality.

### Subjective Idealism: To Be is to Be Perceived

Philosopher **George Berkeley** asserted that “to be is to be perceived.” This means that **reality exists only insofar as it is perceived** by someone. **What I perceive is reality**, but that reality doesn’t exist outside of me. What you perceive is your own reality, and it’s only in the meeting of our perceptions that we create a **common reality**, but one that is always subjective.

### The Uncertainty Principle: Observation Changes Reality

In quantum physics, **Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle** shows that **the very act of observing changes the state of what is observed**. It’s as if, by perceiving the world, I’m already altering what I’m perceiving. This idea reinforces the concept that **my reality is co-created** by my perceptions. It’s not just that I observe a neutral external world: **by observing it, I’m already changing it**.

# Conclusion: The Illusion of Identity and Multiple Realities

We are multiple. I am multiple, even within my own existence, as the "me" of yesterday no longer exists in the same way, and with it disappears its universe, its own reality. Every interaction creates a new universe, a new reality, distinct from the one I may have shared with someone else before. We are sometimes surprised to see our words change depending on the context or the person we’re speaking with, but maybe that’s because we change at every moment. There could be as many versions of us as there are other people, as many realities as there are interactions. In the end, perhaps we are not a single person, but an entanglement of temporary identities, constantly renewing themselves.

Perhaps the energy we expend daily is mainly to keep ourselves in the illusion of coherence, to maintain the idea that our identity is stable and continuous. This work seems necessary, like a compromise between all these versions of ourselves, to preserve the appearance of a stable timeline. This continuity is maintained by our memories, sometimes carefully chosen, sometimes distorted to better fit the narrative we need to believe.

Thus, reality seems to bend under our perceptions. Our memories, our morals, our senses: these may be tools designed to keep us within this illusion of identity, like guardians filtering out the inconsistencies. These filters create the impression of continuity, a bridge between each individual universe we share with others, even though, in truth, we are likely a multiplicity of realities, constantly recreated through our interactions and experiences.
