# The concept of human hacking: exploring the glitches in "reality"

For a long time, I’ve been questioning the nature of the "reality" around us and whether it’s possible to access hidden levels or bypass its rules through unconventional means. The idea that life, much like computer programs or video games, could be coded opens up a fascinating possibility: discovering and exploiting **glitches**, flaws in the system, to achieve higher control or consciousness.

## Everything is code: hacking thought and "reality"

My worldview is based on the idea that everything is code, including our thoughts, actions, and perception of time. All of these follow specific rules, a sort of global algorithm. If the reality we perceive is coded, it makes sense to think that, like in any system, there is underlying **data**—information that governs our perception of the world. At a minimum, we could **read** this data to better understand the rules that structure "reality", and at maximum, we could **modify** it to alter that reality.

We could be a **Man-in-the-Middle**, observing data flows without necessarily intervening but still accessing information without detection, or a **Man-in-the-Browser** (an active hacker), directly modifying information to create tangible impacts on the system. In both cases, it’s about different levels of access to the data: passive access, and active access. The idea that our world, our thoughts, and our existence are based on **modifiable data** makes it plausible that hacking "reality" is possible in various ways, depending on the level of intervention chosen.

## Unexpected behaviors and glitches in "reality"

The idea of **unexpected behaviors** in life is also central to my thinking. Just as in video games, where actions not foreseen by developers can trigger glitches, the reality we perceive might also contain **flaws** waiting to be exploited. It’s often the unexpected or incongruous behaviors that reveal these flaws.

In fact, I was amused to see a similar concept in the film *Everything Everywhere All At Once*, where the protagonist accesses versions of herself in other realities by performing absurd, unexpected actions that no one would think to attempt. Breaking away from **expected behaviors** could well be the key to accessing hidden levels of "reality."

## Programmed flaws or accidental glitches: possible scenarios

Two scenarios emerge here:
- **If reality is a simulation created by an entity** (like video games created by developers), then it’s possible that these flaws are **intentional** (backdoors). They could be corrected as they’re discovered, and only those who know the hidden codes could use them to access higher levels of consciousness or control.
- **If reality is a universal code without an entity** to control it, then these glitches might be **accidental**—errors buried within the system without correction. Those who discover them could exploit them to surpass the limitations of the simulation.

It’s also conceivable that these **two scenarios** are true at the same time. The "reality" we perceive could be both a simulation designed by an entity within a universally coded structure, where hidden levels exist but without constant correction of the flaws.

## The idea of danger as a key to access

**Risky or unusual actions** could be the key to finding these glitches in "reality". To limit lucky discoveries or chances of accidentally stumbling upon these backdoors, it would make sense to hide them within actions no one would willingly attempt. What better way to deter these attempts than to link them with **mortal or dangerous** behaviors?

Take an imaginary example: screaming a specific sound, like **"U"**, while standing with arms crossed and jumping off the 12th floor of a building between 4 am and 5 am, Paris time. Such a behavior, both incongruous and deadly, wouldn’t be attempted without prior knowledge of the "cheat code" to succeed. In short, where there’s a program, there’s a hack.

## Link with religion

When I think about these **mortal behaviors** as potential keys to discover glitches in "reality," the **connection with religion** becomes striking. I’m not saying religions were born from people who might have discovered these flaws in our code, but I’m also not saying it’s impossible.

If we look at it from another angle, many **religious figures** returned from the dead, and some even had powers that seemed to be able to **change reality**. Thinking about it this way, it’s amusing to imagine that these glitches were found and then corrected (or maybe not). The resurrection, the multiplication of bread, and other miracles could be seen from a new perspective: **glitches in "reality"**, moments when the code was hacked to access forbidden or transcendent powers.

## Conclusion: a continuous quest

The concept of **hacking reality** fascinates me, and I will likely return to it often in my reflections. If we accept that **everything is code**, that everything, including our thoughts and perceptions, is governed by programmed rules, then it becomes possible to imagine that glitches exist in our "reality", ready to be exploited. Whether these glitches are hidden in risky or mortal behaviors, or in unexpected actions, the very idea of **hacking reality** is a path worth exploring.

We may not yet have all the answers, but imagining that such hacks exist fuels the quest for understanding and **unraveling the mysteries** of what lies behind our perception of the world.
